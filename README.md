# AI Learning Intelligence Tool

## Overview
This is an AI-powered tool designed to analyze learner data, predict course completion, and identify at-risk students. It features a FastAPI backend and a modern web dashboard.

## Features
- **Course Completion Prediction**: Predicts whether a student will complete a course.
- **Early Risk Detection**: Flags high-risk students based on behavior and performance.
- **Chapter Difficulty Analysis**: Identifies difficult chapters based on time spent and scores.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Visualizes risk distribution and insights.

## AI Usage Disclosure
- **Synthetic Data**: The tool uses a synthetic dataset generated by `scripts/generate_data.py` to simulate student behavior.
- **Models**:
    - **Completion Prediction**: Random Forest Classifier (Scikit-learn).
    - **Risk Detection**: Probability thresholding from the classifier.
    - **Difficulty Analysis**: Statistical aggregation of student performance metrics.
- **Verification**: Models were trained and verified on the synthetic dataset, achieving high accuracy (due to the deterministic nature of the generation logic).

## Setup & Usage

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- pip

### Installation
1.  Clone the repository (or navigate to the project directory).
2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Running the Tool
1.  **Generate Data & Train Models** (First time only):
    ```bash
    python scripts/generate_data.py
    python scripts/train_models.py
    ```
2.  **Start the Server**:
    ```bash
    uvicorn app.main:app --reload
    ```
3.  **Access the Dashboard**:
    Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8000`.

### Testing
- You can use the generated `data/student_data.csv` to test the "Batch Analysis" feature in the dashboard.
